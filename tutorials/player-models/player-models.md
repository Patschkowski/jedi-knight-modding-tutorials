# Create Your Own Player Models with the XSI|Mod Tool

Are you tired of playing with the standard JK2 or JKA player models? Are you simply tired of having to download defective player models all the time? Then you should take a look at this tutorial, because it explains step by step how to create your own player model. And the great thing is that you don't have to spend any money on expensive software. If you're really keen to get started right away, I'm afraid I have to put a bit of a damper on things. You should already know a bit about modeling. If this is not the case, you will find a collection of tutorials to modeling in the appendix to help you get started.

If you get stuck at any point in this introduction or if you have any other requests or questions regarding this documentation, please feel free to [send me an email](mailto:felix.patschkowski@gmail.com). I was also often on the Darth-Arth forum, which is generally a good place to go for all friends of JK modifications. You could also find help there.

Finally, it only remains for me to wish you lots of fun and success with this introduction!
