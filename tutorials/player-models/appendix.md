## Free Programs for Modeling

There are a lot of free programs for modeling. Some are really good and others you can forget about. Below you will find a list of programs that I also use and that you can use for something.

- *gmax* is a neutered version of *3ds Max 4*, it's a bit older and has a lot of bugs, but it's particularly useful for games based on the Quake 3 engine.
- The *XSI|Mod Tool* is relatively new among the free programs. It corresponds to the fourth sales version of XSI. It is interesting because of its importer and exporter for the *Source Engine* from *Valve* and the *Unreal Engine 3*.
- Another program for professional 3D editing is *Maya*. *Maya* has a free offshoot. The *Maya PLE*. I can't say much about the quality of this program because I've only used it briefly. But it doesn't seem to have that many exporters.
- The free program *Blender 3D* is considered complicated to use, but it also runs under Linux. However, I have never used it. *Blender* comes with a render engine and many exporters.

## Introductions to Modeling

The Internet is full of introductions to modeling for various programs. This is therefore only a small collection. You have to teach yourself a lot by trial and error. That doesn't just sound hard, it is. However, once you have achieved something, the success builds you up immensely.

### gmax

The introduction that comes with gmax (*gmax12_tutorials.exe*) will get you a long way. Most of the tutorials for *3ds Max* can also be used for *gmax*.
