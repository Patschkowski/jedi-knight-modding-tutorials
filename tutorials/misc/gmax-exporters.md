## gmax XSI Exporter

After a long time of development, it's finally done. The first version of my \*.xsi exporter for Gmax sees the light of day. You can download it from this repository: [jediknight.mzp](../../jediknight.mzp) Of course it is - as it should be for today's software - not yet completely free of bugs. You are welcome to send them to me.

## gmax ASE Exporter

Recently I was able to program an exporter for *gmax* that can export to ASE format. You can find the exporter in this repository as well: [ase-export.mzp](../../ase-export.mzp). Please note that this exporter is still in the beta phase. So it can't do everything yet and is certainly not error-free. I am therefore happy to receive suggestions for improvement.
