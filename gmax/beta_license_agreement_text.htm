Confidential
Information disclosed by Discreet under this Agreement shall only be
used by you
in the furtherance of this Agreement or the performance of your
obligations
hereunder. Confidential Information shall only be disclosed to your
employees on
a need to know basis, and shall not be disclosed to any third parties

the written consent of Discreet. You agree to promptly notify the
Discreet in
writing of any known misuse, misappropriation, or unauthorized
disclosure of
Confidential Information.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3 Exceptions.</b> The limitations set forth in this Section
shall not apply to information which (a) is rightfully received by you
from
another party without restriction, (b) is known to or developed by you
independently without use of the Confidential Information, (c) is or
becomes
